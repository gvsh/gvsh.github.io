## Reasons Behind The Creation of Analysis

Newton had approached his calculus with fluxions and flows while Leibniz had done with differentials.

Both methods however had to deal with infinities and infinitely small quantities, specifically to find methods that combine infintely many infinitely small quantities to get finite quantities.

The reasoning used to arrive at the methods by Newton and Leibniz was vague. For example, Leibniz correctly stated the result that:

$$
\displaystyle d(uv) = udv + vdu. \ \ \ \ \ (1)
$$

The argument used to derive the result is as follows: Since,

$$
\displaystyle d(uv) = (u + du)(v + dv) - uv \\ = udv + vdu + dudv \ \ \ \ \ (2)
$$

The term $du\thinspace dv$ is a second order differential and thus extremely small compared to the first order differentials and is thus treated as 0.

So there is an inconsistency in the way that differentials are treated. The terms to ignore are arrived at not by reasoning but by back tracking from the correct answer.

Another problem was the treatment of divergent series.

For example, it was proven that

$$
\displaystyle 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \dots = 1 / (1 + x) \ \ \ \ \ (3)
$$

But it was not clear why this result breaks down when {x = 1}:

$$
\displaystyle 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \dots \neq 1/2 \ \ \ \ \ (4)
$$


The works of the leading mathematicians of that time (before the development of what we know today as analysis) – Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, Taylor, D’Alembert etc. included many arguments of suspect validity.

The mathematicians who solved all these problems and the works of whom led to the creation of analysis were (in chronological order) – Lagrange, Cauch, Reimann and Weierstrass. Their contributions are discussed below:

## Lagrange

The initial development of calculus had relied heavily on geometry and geometrical methods and visualization.

Lagrange brought about a shift in treatment of calculus from the geometrical approach to “algebraic analysis” of “analytic functions”.

Analytic function initially had meant any function with a single expression, but Lagrange corrected it to a function which has a convergent Taylor series representation.

While he as right in defining the analytic functions, the arguments he used turned out to be unextendable and thus untenable. This was corrected by Cauchy.

## Cauchy

In the first decades of the nineteenth century, Cauchy revived the limit approach to analysis and gave the definitions of continuity and derivatives in terms of limits.

His greatest contribution to the field of analysis was that he gave clear definitions. For example, he defined the sum of an infinite series as the limit of the sequence of partial sums. This provided a unified approach for series of numbers as well as of functions.

Cauchy also gave the correct definition of continuity, defining it to be on an interval rather than on a point.

His definition of definite integral assumed continuity, which was corrected by Reimann.

Abel found an error in his work that led to the notion of uniform convergence as being different from convergence.

## Reimann

As already noted, Reimann’s main contribution to analysis was the generalization of the definition of definite integral to include discontinuous functions.

As an example, he showed a function, discontinuous on any interval, having an integral.

Dirichlet had corrected an error in Cauchy’s work. While studying the conditions under which the Fourier series expansion of a function converges to the function, Dirichlet succeeded in proving such convergence for a function that has period {2\pi}, is integrable on an interval of that length, does not have infinitely many maxima and minima, and at jump discontinuities takes on the average value between the two limiting values on each side.

Reimann was able to give the generalized definition the definite integral by extending Dirichlet’s method to more cases.

His definition disspelled the idea that integration was the inverse of differentiation, although the relationshiop still held for continuous functions.

## Weierstrass

The two main contributions by Weierstrass are the elimination of the idea of motion from limit processes and the representation of functions.

The new definition of limit without the idea of motion was based on what is now called the topology of the real line or complex plane.

He also developed different classes of functions by using their power series representations.

He also produced counter examples to critique the work of other mathematicians and to point out errors.

One famous example is of the nowhere differentiable but everywhere continous function:

$$
\displaystyle f(x) = \sum b^n \cos(a^n x) \ \ \ \ \ (5)
$$

His approach of producing pathological examples lifted the precision of hypothesis in analysis substantially.
